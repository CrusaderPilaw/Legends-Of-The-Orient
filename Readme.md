# Legends Of The Orient Mod Pack

By installing this mod pack you will receive my reworked vanilla-AIs, as well as my own mods (my totem AIs Scorpion, Snail, Hyena and Bear as well as my noble AIs Robber-Baron, Efendi, Emira and Inquisitor).

**Important**:  
Before installing the pack you should set up a copy of your current crusader installation, since there are a lot of files which will be changed/ swapped out.

## Installation

1. **Download the "Legends Of The Orient" modification**.

2. **Install the Unofficial Stronghold Crusader Patch**  
   After that you'll need to make sure that you have the newest version of the Unofficial Stronghold Crusader Patch (version 2.15a) installed. You will find it in the main folder. Newest version can always be downloaded [here](https://github.com/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases).  
   - Start the patcher, click "Continue" and check in the tabs "AIV", "AIC" and "troops" the corresponding files. (Every file with "Legenden_Des_Ostens" in the front.) Press "Install".

3. **Copy the data sets**  
   Now you can copy the data sets from the folders "binks", "fx" und "gm" in the corresponding folder in your OWN Stronghold Crusader (Extreme) game. This replacement has to be done by hand, but you'll only have to do it once.  
   (These files mainly replace the AIs' identity; videos, voicelines and portraits. In case you want to keep the old files, remember to save them somewhere.)  
   - The audio files have to be placed in the "speech" folder, which can be found in the "fx" folder.  
   - In the gm folder you'll mainly need the "interface_icons2.gm1"-file. This one HAS to be pasted into your game! Additionally, I added some other gm files in an extra folder. Here you will find skins for workshops and troops I got from the original Stronghold 1 game.  
   Remember to name them right by deleting the "EUROPEAN" brackets I added. The "MIXED"-Datei contains the workshops how I am using them: Armourer, Blacksmith and Fletcher with European skins, Poleturner and Tanner with Crusader skins.

4. **Copy the "cr" and "extremeTrail" files**  
   Lastly, you will have to copy the "cr" and "extremeTrail" files into the Stronghold Crusader main folder. (These files manage among other things all text files of the game; so it affects the names of the AIs. Again; if you want to keep the original files remember to save or rename them.)  
   - In case you want to play my version of the Extreme Trail you will have to re-install the UCP and choose the "Trail_goods". Please note: The trail is not finished yet! I only did 10 out of 20 missions and for now they are not in the right order. The level of difficulty varies a lot. Still: If you are looking for handmade missions with my AIs and are up for a challenge, this might be something for you!

5. **Maps folder**  
   I also added a maps folder.  
   - **retraced maps**: If you choose to copy/ paste these maps into your maps and mapsExtreme folder you will be able to play the "retraced" maps.  
   Together with Krarilotus I reworked all the second Trail maps of the base game, since they were bugged af, ugly and too small. Also you can use these for custom skirmish Setups! For this case as well they work a lot better than the originals. So I strongly suggest you choose these maps! A video addressing all the benefits of these maps can be found [here on Krarilotus' channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbVAEWBDVE&t=1s).  
   - **AI fight maps**: If you choose to copy/ paste these maps into your maps and mapsExtreme folder you will be able to play all the maps I made myself and usually use for my AI fights. So if you are looking for any of the maps you saw on my channel, you will probably find them here. These maps are mirrored! To achieve this I used the mirror tool by gynt. Although these maps are pretty detailed, every tile of land perfectly matches on the opposing side. This means fights between AIs are a lot more balanced than they could ever be on any handmade map. Of course, you can also use these for custom skirmish setups. (I didn't add ALL the maps I ever created, because some of them are just really old and don't work that well anymore.)  
   - **Pilaw Trail maps**: If you choose to copy/ paste these maps into your mapsExtreme folder (NOT maps!) you will be able to play my version of the extreme Trail.

6. **Start Stronghold Crusader Extreme**  
   Now you can start Stronghold Crusader Extreme.
